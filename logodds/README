logodds project and ranksum project. 
This folder contains the C++ program and source code to predict binding site loci within CRMs for putative PWMs for the DC and DU detectors (the optimal clusters) for a putative cooperating binding sites from a Twist PWM.  The odds of DC predicting adjacency to Twist is computed and similarly the odds of DU predicting adjacency to Twist is computed.

The program also constructs the sampling distribution of the rank sum statistic (which is the log of the p value of the rank sum of median energies of DC and DU core sites (training data)).  This data is generated by constructing random partitions of all the training data, and constructing PWMs for each partition, which then score each site used to build the PWM (these scores are then passed to a matlab program).

RUNNING THE PROGRAM


To run the C/C++ program (seq2exp) for your data (fasta of binding sites, fasta of CRMs, and a potential motif that cooperates with the binding sites in the fasta), just use all of the data we have supplied for the original/old GEMSTAT parameters, while assigning my new parameters to your data (you may have to rename some of our supplied data to correspond to your 'names', or vice versa, this can be determined by analyzing how the data is being used in seq2exp.cpp ).  An example of running the program (for i=1, j=0 (see where logodds is called in masterscript.sh)):

./seq2exp -bs fas.txt -bi topbot2Int.txt -s efastanotw12.txt  -p synmyout -e expre12.tab -m factordts.wtmx -f factorexpdts2.tab -na 0 -i factorinfodts.txt -o BINS -c coopdt.txt -fo out.txt -oo corr -du coreOPT"$j""du"$i.txt  -dc coreOPT"$j"dc$i.txt -tw Ebox.txt -sa  NEEandREPseq.txt   -pva .0005 -cbo coreOPT"$j"cb$i.txt   -l 9 -nr 8 -ip 1  -nu 2 -w 1 -m2 twmotifs.wtmx -fi 20

PROGRAM USAGE for my 'new parameters' relative to GEMSTAT's original parameters that are defined in Xin's README (which is pasted below)


Explanation of my new parameters that are relevant for usage: 

-dc <seq_file>: required, a sequence file in FASTA format. This is a binding site fasta file.  It is the loci that cooperate with the putative cooperating motif (Twist in our case).  A PWM is built from these sequences, and used to 'predict' sites.  

-du <seq_file>: required, a sequence file in FASTA format.  This is a binding site fasta file.  It is the loci that do not cooperate with the putative cooperating motif (Twist in our case).  A PWM is built from these sequences, and used to 'predict' sites.

-tw <seq_file>: required, a sequence file of Twist binding sites in FASTA format.  This is required, but the results are not sensitive to this parameter (since it's not being utilized).

-sa  <seq_file>: required, a sequence file in FASTA format.  This is the CRM sequences that contain the known binding site loci.

-pva <p value>: not required, the threshold of the cumulative distribution of the binding site energies, this is used to convert a pvalue into an energy threshold (for example, in a uniform background distribution of binding sites, this can compute the energy that coorresponds to a sequence that is expected to be observed every one million observations (pva = 10^(-6)), see the PvaluSum function.

-cbo <seq_file>: required, a sequence file in FASTA format.  This is the initial CB sites (all known binding site sequences).  This is required, but the results are not sensitive to this parameter  (since it's not being utilized).

-l <length>: required, the length of the desired alignment.

-nr <number random iterations>: required, the number of gibbs samples for alignment program.

-ip <initial position>: required, the coordinate (zero-based) of the initial position of the binding site within a binding site alignment that is based on 'one binding site per sequence'.

-nu <number of updates>: required, the number of updates of the EM algorithm in the alignment of binding sites.

-w <width>: required, the distance the gibbs sampler is allowed to randomly generate starting postions within each extended sequence for alignment (if set to large could potentiall cause segmentation fault).

-m2 <motif_file>: required, the PWMs (motifs) of the putative cooperating Transcription Factors (Twist motifs in our case). 

-fi <file index>: not required, used in matlab scripts that are not currently being used.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
an additional couple pieces of data are being input through the parameters -bs -bi, which are Chip chip data (chip sequences) and binding intensities for the chip (in our case for Dorsal Chip-chip).  These were merged from STAP program, and our results are insensitve to their use (since it's not being utilized).

INSTALLATION

The program needs GSL (GNU Scientific Library). After installing GSL, change the GSL directory in src/Makefile. Then type: 
cd src
make

The main executable will be generates: 
seq2expr: the main program to fit a sequence-to-expression model

Type the program name without parameters will print usage information. 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
PROGRAM USAGE

The program takes as input: sequences, the expression profiles of these sequences, the PWMs of the relevant TFs and the expression profiles of these TFs, and computes the paramaters of the underlying sequence-to-expression model as well as the predicted expression patterns.

The data/ directory contain the example files. A simple command of running the program: 
$INSTALL_DIR/src/seq2expr -s seqs.fa -e expr.tab -m factors.wtmx -f factor_expr.tab -fo obs_pre.txt -i factor_info.txt -o Direct

For more examples of running the program with various options, see the run.sh script (need to modify the installation directory of the script). 

Explanation of parameters: 
-s <seq_file>: required, the sequence file in FASTA format. See data/seqs.fa. 

-e <expr_file>: required, the expression data of the sequences. The first line specifies the name of the expression conditions. See data/expr.tab. 

-m <motif_file>: required, the PWM (motif) of the relevant TFs. See data/factors.wtmx. 

-f <factor_expr_file>: required, the expression data of the TFs. Must match the format of expr_file, and the order of TFs in motif_file. See data/factor_expr.tab. 

-fo <output_file>: required, the output file, the predicted expression patterns of all sequences as well as the observed expression patterns (alternating, the first row is the observed and the second the predicted). 

-o <model_option>: the sequence-to-expression model. Options are: Logistic, Direct (DirectInt model), ChrMod_Unlimited (SRR model with N_MA = inf), ChrMod_Limited (SRR model with finite N_MA). 

-c <coop_file>: the list of cooperative interactions. One line per cooperative pair. If not specified, then no cooperative interaction is allowed. See data/coop_file. 

-i <factor_info_file>: the role of TFs (activators or repressors). This would be required for SRR models. See data/factor_info.txt. The second column indicates whether the TF is an activator and the third whether repressor (in theory, an activator could have two roles, thus we have two columns). 

-oo <obj_option>: the option of objective function. Options are: SSE - sum of squared error (default), Corr - average correlation coefficient. 

-mc <max_contact>: the N_MA parameter of the SRR model. 

-p <par_file>: the parameter file. When this option is specified, the values of the parameters in par_file will be used as initial parameter values of the optimizer. In particular, if no parameter estimation is performed (with the option: -na 0, see below), the parameter values will be used for predicting expression patterns. 

-na <nAlternations>: a parameter of the optimizer. The number of alternations between two optimization methods (GSL simplex method and GSL BFGS method). If it is 0, no parameter estimation. Typically 3 to 5. 

-a <annotation_file>: the file of sequences represented by a set of TFBSs (site annotation). With this option, only the specified sites will be used in the sequence-to-expression model. See data/seqs_p002.ann. Note that in the file, the first column is the start position of a site (from 1), the second is the strand of the site, and the last the factor name. 

-ct <coopDistThr>: the distance threshold of cooperative interactions. Default = 50 bp. 

-rt <repressionDistThr>: the distance threshold of short range repression. Default = 150 bp.

SOURCE CODE

The main classes and functions of the program: 

Tools.*
The utility classes and functions, e.g. Matrix class, mathematical functions, I/O classes. 

class Sequence (SeqAnnotator.h): 
The DNA sequences, represented as a vector of A,C,G,T. The functions that read and write sequences in FASTA format are also included. 

class Motif (SeqAnnotator.h): 
The PWM representation of binding profiles. Defined the methods for computing the LLR score and mismatch energy of any sequence element. Also included read/write functions. 

class Site (SeqAnnotator.h): 
The TF binding sites. The data members are: position, which TF the site is associted with (index), and its mismatch energy and binding affinity (:= exp(-energy)). 

class SeqAnnotator (SeqAnnotator.h): 
Create the site representation of a sequence, i.e. a Sequence object can now be represented as a vector of Site objects. All sites that exceed certain energy thresholds will be extracted. 

class FactorIntFunc (ExprPredictor.h): 
The function that computes the interaction between two occupied TFBSs, according to the TF pairs, the distance and orientation of the sites. 

class ExprPar (ExprPredictor.h): 
The parameters of a sequence-to-expression model, including the binding parameters (K of the strongest site multiplied by TF_max, see the paper), the activation parameters (alpha), the repression parameters (beta), the basal transcription, and the TF-TF interaction matrix. Because some models only have a subset of these parameters (e.g. beta is only used in the SRR model),  methods are defined to: 1) create an ExprPar object by a vector of free parameters (constructor); 2) extract all free parameters from the ExprPar object: getFreePars() function. Exactly how these methods are implemented depend on the current model option (static ModelType modelOption). 

class ExprFunc (ExprPredictor.h): 
The class that predicts expression level of a sequence (represented by a vector of Site objects)according to TF expression levels and the model parameters. The main function is predictExpr(). For thermodynamic models, this main function is implemented through compPartFuncOff() and compPartFuncOn(). These two functions implemented the dynamic programming algorithms in the paper. Also note that all model parameters are supposed to known. 

class ExprPredictor (ExprPredictor.h): 
This is the main class of the program. 
* It contains data members that store the input data of the program: sequences and their expression profiles, the PWMs and expression profiles of TF. It computes the best model parameters through the method train() (saved in the data member ExprPar par_model), and can be applied to a new sequence through the method predict(). 
* The main optimization methods are: simplex_minimize() and gradient_minimize(). These two methods use the GSL functions, see GSL manual for the style of using the library. Also the two functions print information when doing optimization. This could be turned off by commenting out the lines in the main do-while loop. 
* Also note that several functions are defined to deal with parameters: testPar() for testing if the parameter ranges are valid and randomSamplePar() sample randomly parameter values (for random starts of the optimizer). 

seq2expr.cpp
The main() function. The default values of many parameters are defined here. Also control the output.
